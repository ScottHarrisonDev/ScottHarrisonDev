### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Fullstack JavaScript Developer with over 12 years of commercial experience.

I currently work for [Studio Rotate](https://studiorotate.com/) building award winning e-commerce websites such as [biggreenegg.co.uk](https://www.biggreenegg.co.uk/), [rapha.cc](https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/) and [tracksmith.com](https://www.tracksmith.com/gb).

### Skills

I've worked with many languages, frameworks and tools over the years but my current work is mostly focused around **TypeScript, React, Vue, Node, Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind**

### Passions

I'm passionate about web accessibility, unit testing, coding standards and value learning the underlying language and software patterns rather than simply learning a framework
